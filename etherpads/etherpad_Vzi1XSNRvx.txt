#Splitting into Modules and Lessons

##Mission Statement: 

To train researchers in the best practices of reproducible computation to increase transparency and accelerate scientific progress.

Tagline: Accelerating scientific progress through reproducible science. 

## Learning objectives:

At the end of the course, students will be able to
* Appreciate the importance of making research more reproducible.
* blah blah the organization of digital artifacts of computation
* blah blah the documentation of the how and the why of computational analysis
* blah blah the importance of  
* Choose and evaluate tools, technologies, and formats that promote the reproducibility of their computational work.  
* blah blah making one's computational work and results discoverable, accessible and reusable  by others

concerete materials to be produced (i think?):
- checklist/survey for "how reproducible are you?" for pre and post survey and flyer
- curated list of resources for where to get started, e.g. codeschool, etc.
- overall walk-away lessons: X things you want to remember even if you slept through the whole thing
- (maybe) folder structure
