Distribution logistics

# Jobs:

* Common taxonomy (master master, us/them, different repos etc)
* Set up proof of concept for travis lesson checking
* Documentation for rrhack organisers, bootcamp organisers, students

# Travis

Travis for R.  This is the repo that has code
https://github.com/craigcitro/r-travis
This is the recipes, which is super useful for designing new configurations.
https://github.com/craigcitro/r-travis/wiki/Recipes

Here is the configuration file for a knitr document
https://github.com/csgillespie/travis-examples/blob/knitr/.travis.yml

The one missing bit is that we really don't want a DESCRIPTION file in the repo, because it's very prominently named and will confuse the students.  But I think we can solve this with a .description file that travis will rename.

Builds will be listed here:
https://travis-ci.org/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/rr-logistics/ (travis: unix build)
https://ci.appveyor.com/project/richfitz/rr-logistics (appveyor: windows build)
(travis has a long queue at the moment)

Code for buttons:

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/570yfu7cflc3st2j?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/richfitz/rr-logistics)

This is quite likely to change in a little bit, but it will only get simpler and the current solution should work for a while

# Ideas for things to test

* Does a knitr document compile?
* Does a derived data set match the master data set? (This is relevant for org1 vs org2)
* Is a directory of figures set up?
* Pull request example: https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/rr-logistics/pull/2 - left off a closing backtick

# Unresolved

* It would be nice if Rscript could run in verbose mode (done)
* Need to run travis over every subdirectory on the combined repo. (done)
* Will need to manually enable travis on the new combined repo (not sure this is doable via api, but is not *that* big a deal)
* Run each script with `try`, and throw at the end if any failed.  This will pick up more errors.
* Skip a directory if .ci_tests.R is not present
* Make sure that the system calls actually fail - intern=TRUE might be enough.
* Get links to the website running from each repo
* Build a table of contents for the metarepo home page
