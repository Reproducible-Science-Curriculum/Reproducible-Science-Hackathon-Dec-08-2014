# Summary of Day 2 morning breakouts
 
## Group 1
https://etherpad.mozilla.org/RsVqAuHbxM 
 * start with exercises, testimonials, checklist / rubric
 * organization: guided example of untidy project -> tidy project
 * publish: small groups to discuss risks of being open
 * general themes: avoid evangelism
 * mixed feelings about teaching git and github

## Group 2
https://etherpad.mozilla.org/RI95QSaZvB
 * checklist: have people fill out before workshop
 * start with exercise of reproducing something short 
 * organization: exercise organizing sets of files, followed by an introduction to a well-organized example; provide template
 * narration: 1. non-executable doc; 2. basic scripting; 3. literate programming (demo)
 * themes: showing examples of scripting without actually teaching scripting; possible split of class at some point between scripting / version control
 * publication: create best practices for licensing; need to discuss at start of project (with collaborators, funders, institution)

## Group 3
https://etherpad.mozilla.org/oLoI1RJZma
 * starting exercise: give everyone a dataset and tell them to make a figure, have to pass to second participant to reproduce -> generate teachable moments
 * get to literate programming by end of day 1 (RMD?); walk though existing and make small change rather than start from scratch
 * day 2: moving from better to best; make-like things
 * end with publication
 * themes: spiraling through concepts vs separate modules (organization / documentation / publication); use common dataset through workshop or substitute with different dataset ("the workshop is reproducible!")

Gaps:
 * Common executable convention for how to organize and structure a project from the start. 
 * Something like make, but not make.
 * Checklist for reproducibility
