Discussion on datasets for lessons for reproducible research
 
What does a row in the dataset look like:

Data characteristics
Start as somewhat messy
Have a clean version available
Have code available that made the data clean 
Be able to be partitioned into multiple files for file organization lesson
Minimum number of variable and variable types - factor, numeric, character
At least enough rows to make spreadsheets painful
Raises curiosity - interesting without explicit domain knowledge
Having year or date as a variable to look at temporal variability, a scale up possibility
Having dates to demonstrate how to do dates and to not just have empty cells where dates are implied
there's an analysis done already that we can reproduce 
interesting questions to ask of the dataset
having code that does something and students can come in and change a variable and get a new analysis
opportunities to write new analyses as a part of the workshop for more advanced
descriptions of how the data was collected
descriptions of variable names
ability to explore the data without loading it in to R
- publicly available, even in a standard data repository 
no license required for reuse of data CC0
current relevance
state of readiness for use in lessons
broadly interesting
illustrations of different ways that things have been published, ways of making it available
if datasets aren't in a standard data repository, can we put it there?
can make dataset available as an R package to R users
needs to be a dataset that would plausibly change either over time (movies/baby names) or with collaborations/new studies (woody plants paper)

Ideas
1. movies: https://stat.duke.edu/~mc301/data/movies.Rdata (a version, one we use would be  extended)
 * observations: each row is a movie
 * data dictionary: https://stat.duke.edu/courses/Fall14/sta101.001/project/project2.html
 * pros: most work already done (and interim data cleaning steps available), variety of data types, not hard to come up with interesting questions, has date fields (year and release date)
 * cons: not necessarily interesting to everyone

2. baby names: 
https://github.com/hadley/babynames
http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html
 * observations: each row is a name
 * pros: easily accessible, 
 * cons: variables are only year, name, sex, count

3. Lemur data
http://lemur.duke.edu
http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.fj974
 * pros: biology-ish application / scientific gravitas on dryad as well as alternative source, lemurs are cute
 * cons: would require new work (would not be ready by after lunch), requires domain knowledge

4. Other options:
- Look at Dryad for datasets
- Dialect survey in the US: involves mapping, so likely too complex
- Gapminder: ready to go as well (Jenny has documented journey from Excel spreadsheets to csv to R data package https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder )

- publication data

Question: Is the choice of dataset a funding consideration?
