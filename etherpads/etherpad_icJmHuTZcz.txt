At the beginning of this workshop, participants should be able to 
 * to use a spreadsheet program to generate a plot
 * to use word to communicate

At the end of this session, students will be able to... 
...recognize the problems related to reproducible research
 * organization
 * documentation
 * automation
 * data/documentation sharing
... identify pain points in getting their analysis to be reproducible



Preconceived ideas
 * They don't have a problem
 * Discussion with organization group
   * Projects aren't big enough for a folder structure
   * I am storing images.  I am not doing computation
   * Difference in binary vs. text flies
 * Discussion with publishing group
   * sharing, archival, and publication are non-synonymous
   * publication is not all-or-nothing that comes solely at the end, but is stepwise
 * Discussion with narration group
   * I will remember what I did/what may really non-descriptive column names and codes mean
 * Discussion with versioning group
   * ???



Itinerary (180 min)
 * get settled/Intro junk (10 min)
 * introduce case study (Amgen example?) and relate students pain points to real-world pain points from case study (10 min)
 * Loop 1 (75 min)
   * everyone is given a common dataset - half the group gets one question or task and the other half gets a separate question (30 min)
   * swap with person from different group and follow their instructions (20 min)
   * Time to talk with partner
     * make note of the problems or pain points associated with trying to follow another persons workflow

 * <Coffee Break> (15 min)

   * Time to talk with bigger group
     * Decompress with salient points from the exercise
     * Collect data on what people were actually using as tools for the two loops - pre-asssessment

 * Loop 2 (75 min)
   * organization
     * New data in different format (column order, number, names)
   * automation
     * Generate same plot as before with added data and tweak to deliverable
   * Dealing with feedback -> have updated documentation
   * Decompress (faster this time around)
     * Talking w/ partner
     * Talking w/ group
 * Summary of morning and point forward (10 min)
   * point towards the tools that we'll be getting to over the next two days to solve these problems
