Dear Meeting Participants, 

We are extremely excited about the excellent list of attendees who have committed to the Reproducible Science Hackathon for Workflow and Curriculum Development. We have a diverse group with varying expertise, all united by a passion for the practice and education of reproducible science. 

We are using a [Github repository](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/Reproducible-Science-Hackathon-Dec-08-2014) as a central location for all information surrounding the hackathon and will use the wiki and issue tracker as the main mode of communication.  Please sign up for a free Github account if you do not already have one. 

Prior to the meeting, we request your participation on a few items.  

1. In order for us all to learn about each other, please introduce yourself by adding your name, Github ID, and a brief introduction of your background on the [participant list](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/Reproducible-Science-Hackathon-Dec-08-2014/wiki/2.-Participants).
2. Start an [Issue](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/Reproducible-Science-Hackathon-Dec-08-2014/issues) on possible topics to be discussed as a group during the hackathon. 
3. Add yourself or suggest a topic for the [lightning talk sessions](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/Reproducible-Science-Hackathon-Dec-08-2014/wiki/4.-Lightning-Talks). 

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions about the event. We look forward to all of the great discussions and will see you in December!

Sincerely, 
Ciera Martinez

On behalf of the organizing committee: Karen Cranston, Hilmar Lapp, Fran√ßois Michonneau, Matt Pennell, Tracy Teal
